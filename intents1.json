This can include practicing meditation, devotional service, and selfless actions. Remember, your ultimate goal is to attain liberation from the cycle of birth and death and to return to your original spiritual home.As I say in the Bhagavad Gita (2.13), Just as the embodied soul continuously passes from childhood to youth to old age, similarly, at the time of death, the soul passes into another body. The wise are not deluded by such a change.So do not be perturbed by the changes that you see in your material body. Focus on your spiritual identity and strive towards achieving that transcendental goal."],

This principle of performing one's duty without attachment is called Karma Yoga. It will help you transcend the duality of pleasure and pain and bring equanimity of mind.
