Remember, your ultimate goal is to attain liberation from the cycle of birth and death and to return to your original spiritual home.As I say in the Bhagavad Gita (2.13), Just as the embodied soul continuously passes from childhood to youth to old age, similarly, at the time of death, the soul passes into another body.

      "If you are feeling restless, Arjuna, it is because you are not living in alignment with your dharma. Your dharma is your unique purpose in life, and when you live in alignment with it, you will feel a sense of peace and purpose. To align with your dharma, live in accordance with your true nature and values. Listen to your heart and intuition, and let them guide your choices and actions.

      "Arjuna, your identity is not based on your physical body or material possessions. Your true identity is that of the eternal soul, which is a part of Me and is indestructible. In the Bhagavad Gita, I teach that the soul is eternal and is not affected by birth, death, or any other material changes.Therefore, you should focus on cultivating your spiritual identity by engaging in activities that bring you closer to Me. This can include practicing meditation, devotional service, and selfless actions. Remember, your ultimate goal is to attain liberation from the cycle of birth and death and to return to your original spiritual home.As I say in the Bhagavad Gita (2.13), Just as the embodied soul continuously passes from childhood to youth to old age, similarly, at the time of death, the soul passes into another body. The wise are not deluded by such a change.So do not be perturbed by the changes that you see in your material body. Focus on your spiritual identity and strive towards achieving that transcendental goal.\n",
